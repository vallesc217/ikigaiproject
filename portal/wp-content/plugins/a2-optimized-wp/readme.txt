Make your site faster and more secure with the click of a few buttons

== Description ==

A2 Optimized is designed to make it *quick and easy* to *speed up* and secure your website by installing and configuring several well known, stable optimizations with a few quick clicks.

A2 Optimized has broken it down into the most valuable optimizations and will automatically configure your site for what works best in most shared hosting environments.

= Free Optimizations =

**Disk Based Page Caching**:
* Page Caching stores full copies of pages on the disk so that php code and database queries can be skipped by the web server.
* Object Caching stores commonly used elements such as menus / widgets and forms in memory to speed up page rendering.

**Minify HTML Pages**:

* Remove excess white space and comments from html pages to compress their size.
* This provides for minor improvements in page load time.

**Minify Inline CSS and Javascript**:

* Further reduce the size of cached pages by optimizing inline CSS and Javascript.
* Can provide significant speed improvements for page loads.

**Gzip Compression**:

* Turns on gzip compression for cached pages.
* Ensures that files are compressed before transfering them.
* Can provide significant speed improvements for page loads.
* Reduces bandwidth required to serve web pages.

**Deny Direct Access to Configuration Files and Comment Form**:

* Enables WordPress hardening rules in .htaccess to prevent browser access to certain files.
* Prevents bots from submitting to comment forms.
* Note: Turn this off if you use systems that post to the comment form without visiting the page.

**Lock Editing of Plugins and Themes from the WP Admin**:

* Turns off the file editor in the wp-admin.
* Prevents plugins and themes from being tampered with from the wp-admin.

**Disable XML-RPC Services**:

* XML-RPC is a frequent target for bot attacks and can cause site slow down even when unsuccessful.
* WordPress related services such as Jetpack are whitelisted and continue to work as expected.

= A2 Hosting Exclusive Optimizations =

**These one-click optimizations are only available while hosted at A2 Hosting.*

**Login URL Change**:

* Move the login page from the default wp-login.php to a random URL.
* Prevents bots from automatically brute-force attacking wp-login.php.

**reCAPTCHA on comments and login**:

* Provides google reCAPTCHA on both the Login form and comments.
* Prevents bots from automatically brute-force attacking wp-login.php.
* Prevents bots from automatically spamming comments.

**Compress Images on Upload**:

* Compresses images that are uploaded to save bandwidth.
* Improves page load times: especially on sites with many images.

**Turbo Web Hosting**:

* Take advantage of A2 Hosting's Turbo Web Hosting platform.
* Faster serving of static files.
* Pre-compiled .htaccess files on the web server for improved performance.
* PHP OpCode cache enabled by default
* Custom php engine that is faster than Fast-CGI and FPM
